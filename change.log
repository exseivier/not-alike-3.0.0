New version. 3.1.0

contains an additional special function called search-only.
Example:
	not-alike3 search-only \
	-g split_out/input_split.{PID}.fasta \
	-db dbase/data/NoSfru.txt \
	--config-file toml/blast_strategy.toml \
	-c "Leave a comment"

It takes the almost the same arguments as is in search command, but instead of take the query fasta genome, it takes the intpu_split file and skips the split sequences procedure to go directly to blast searchings.
